Hello every body ! 

So, this is an app which can generate a pdf with a server and a client. 
If that not working, just send a message to me and i'll take a look on the code. 


Before use the code : 
- Make you sure about the dependencies ( npx create-react-app nameOfYourFolder)
- Don't forget to get axios dependencies in "client"
- Install nodemon for "server" (npm install -g nodemon)

And that just a template, so if you want to change the sections you're free but at your own risk. 

Bye and enjoy !
